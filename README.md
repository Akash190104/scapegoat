Scapegoat
==========

Scapegoat is a Scala static code anaylzer, what is more colloquially known as a code lint tool. Scapegoat works in a similar vein to Java's findbugs or checkstyles, or Scala's Scalastyle.

A static code anaylzer is a tool that flag suspicious langage usage in code. This can include behavior likely to lead or bugs, non idiomatic usage of a language, or just code that doesn't conform to specified style guidelines.

### Usage
Scapegoat is developed as a scala compiler plugin, which can then be used inside your build tool.
